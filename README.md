> **ODSC East 2026 — Hands-On Workshop**
> Build a production-grade multi-agent RAG system that decomposes complex queries, applies dynamic filtering, and orchestrates intent-based conversations over a vector database.

## Overview

Many agentic RAG systems fail in production for the same reason: they treat every user query as a single retrieval problem. Real users ask complex, multi-part questions that span multiple semantic areas of a database and when their needs shift mid-conversation, monolithic agents fall apart entirely.

This workshop builds from the ground up. Starting with vector database fundamentals and ending with a fully functioning intent-based multi-agent orchestration system, you will leave with working code you can extend, a clear mental model of conversational agent design, and the evaluation tools to know when your system is production-ready.

## What You'll Learn

### [Part 1: Vector Database Fundamentals](notebooks/1-vector-db-fundamentals.ipynb)
**Foundation** (0:00 – 0:20): How vector databases store and retrieve contextual information
- Spin up a local Qdrant instance using Docker
- Load an e-commerce dataset and embed it with OpenAI
- Perform semantic and filtered searches
- Apply payload filters for precise results
- **Key insight**: Why retrieval quality is the foundation everything else is built on

### [Part 2: Query Decomposition and Dynamic Filtering](notebooks/2-query-decomposition.ipynb)
**Hands-on build** (0:20 – 1:00): Agents that make complex queries surgical
- Build agents with Pydantic AI that generate dynamic filters from natural language
- Decompose complex multi-part queries into discrete targeted retrieval calls
- Combine query optimization with smart filtering for production-grade results
- **Key insight**: AI agents aren't magic, they are structured prompts + intelligent parsing + API orchestration

### [Part 3: Intent-Based Multi-Agent Orchestration](notebooks/3-intent-orchestration.ipynb)
**Live demo + walkthrough** (1:00 – 1:45): Where single-turn RAG becomes conversational AI
- Intent classifier that identifies what the user is actually trying to accomplish
- Orchestrator that routes to intent-specific subagents
- Slot-filling layer that collects required information through natural clarifying questions
- State management that handles intent switches mid-conversation with clean resets
- **Key insight**: How intent-based design differs fundamentally from rank-based routing

### [Part 4: Evaluation and Production Patterns](notebooks/4-evaluation.ipynb)
**Wrap-up** (1:45 – 2:00): Know when your system is actually working
- Retrieval evaluation with MRR, NDCG, and precision metrics
- Production failure modes: intent bleed, slot hallucination, low-confidence deadlocks
- **Key insight**: If you can't measure it, you can't improve it

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker Desktop ([download here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/))
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- A code editor with Jupyter notebook support — [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) recommended

> **Important**: The full setup downloads ~720 MB of data (Docker image, Python packages, and dataset). **Complete all setup at home before the workshop.** Conference Wi-Fi will not reliably support these downloads.

### Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saskinosie/Enhancing-Context-Engineering-Workshop.git
cd Enhancing-Context-Engineering-Workshop
```

**2. Pull the Qdrant Docker image (~70 MB)**
```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant:v1.17.1
```

**3. Create virtual environment and install Python dependencies (~400 MB)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Pre-download the HuggingFace dataset (~250 MB)**
```bash
python -c "from datasets import load_dataset; load_dataset('Qdrant/hm_ecommerce_products', split='train'); print('Dataset downloaded and cached.')"
```

**5. Configure credentials**
```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp .env.example .env
# Windows (Command Prompt)
copy .env.example .env
```
Then open `.env` and add your OpenAI API key.

**6. Start Qdrant**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Qdrant will be available at `http://localhost:6333` (REST API) and `localhost:6334` (gRPC). You can also view the dashboard at `http://localhost:6333/dashboard`.

**7. Verify installation**

Open the project folder in VS Code or Cursor, then open `notebooks/1-vector-db-fundamentals.ipynb` and run the first few cells to confirm everything is working.
